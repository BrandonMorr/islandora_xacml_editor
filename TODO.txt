TODO:
=====

Highest priority
----------------

- Change the query_alter hook so we don't blow away the previous query. This will be an issue when we are applying namespace restrictions. This will require a refactor to how we build queries, a query builder (a tech task that needs to be done).

High priority
-------------

- Child query hook implementation for newspaper and book. Implications that fall under implementing these as well.

- POLICY addition to children on batching.

- Refactor the big module file into smaller separate files.

- Update DS-COMPOSITE-MODELS of content models so that MIME Type completion is more accurate.
